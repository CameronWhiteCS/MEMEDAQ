# STONKS!

## About

The MEMEDAQ is a community-driven online stock exchange for memes. Players can invest in memes from a variety of categories in a bid to earn their DogeCoin fortune or die trying.

## Gameplay

Players start out with a balance of 10,000 DogeCoins which can be used to purchase shares of memes from the stonks page. Meme prices fluxuate every 2 hours and can even be influenced by real world events visible on the MEMEDAQ news feed. Market saturation, adoption by politicians and/or the mainstream media, and boomerfication are all events that can influce a meme's trading price.

To keep things fresh, all memes are destined to eventually become cringe as a product of our cringe decay function. The older a meme, the more likely it is to become cringe. Once it does, its market value plummets and cannot recover unless the meme becomes post-ironic (example: 2009 Doge versus modern Doge).

In addition to earning players a spot on the highscores page, dogecoins can be spent on non-stock investments, used to bribe politicians, and even hire a hitman to rob other players. Each of these activites has its own risks and rewards.

## Installing the MEMEDAQ App (TODO)

The MEMEDAQ is available for installation on both mobile and desktop devices as a progressive web app (PWA).
